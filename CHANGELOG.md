- Add changelog file.
- Fix: README Mermaid diagram failed to render on GitHub due to syntax error (subgraph label format). Updated to `subgraph <id> [Label]` and replaced `\n` with `<br/>` in node labels; adjusted arrow notation for GitHub Mermaid. Added ASCII fallback remains unchanged.
- Docs: Verified APIDs/IDs consistency across ICDs; no changes needed for this fix.
